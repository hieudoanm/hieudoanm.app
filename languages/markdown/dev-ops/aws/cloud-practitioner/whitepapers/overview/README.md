## Introduction

- AWS provides a highly reliable, scalable, low-cost infrastructure platform in the cloud that powers hundreds of thousands of businesses in 190 countries around the world.

## What is Cloud Computing

- IT Infrastructure (compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources)
  - AWS owns and maintaines the network-connected hardware required for these application services
- A cloud services platform via the Internet
- Pay-as-you-go pricing

## Six Advantages of Cloud Computing

- **Trade capital expense for variable expense**: Pay as you go instead of upfront investment
- **Benefit from massive economies of scale**: Since there are a lot of other users, AWS was able to achieve economies of scale => Lower price for you.
- **Stop guessing capacity**: AWS allows you to scale as you go.
- **Increase speed and agility**: AWS allows you to scale QUICKLY as you go.
- **Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers**: AWS sets up database (SQL, MongoDB, ..) for you.
- **Go global in minutes**: AWS possesses server sites across the world => you can host your application around the world to reduce latency.

## Types of Cloud Computing

- Each type of cloud service and deployment method provides you with different levels of control, flexibility, and management.
- Understanding the differences between Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service, and Software as a Service, as well as what deployment strategies you can use, can help you decide what set of services is right for your needs.

### Cloud Computing Models

- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
  - Network features, computers (virtual or hardware), data storage space.
  - Highest level of flexibility and management control
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
  - Focus on the deployment and management of your applications.
- Software as a Service (SaaS)
  - A completed product that is run and managed by the service provider. (e.g. Email Service)

### Cloud Computing Deployment Models

- Cloud
  - A cloud-based application is fully deployed in the cloud and all parts of the application run in the cloud
- Hybrid
  - A combination of Cloud and On-premises
- On-premises
  - In most cases this deployment model is the same as legacy IT infrastructure while using application management and virtualization technologies to try and increase resource utilization.

## Global Infrastructure

- AWS serves over a million active customers in more than 190 countries.
- An AWS Region is a physical location in the world where we have multiple Availability Zones.
  - over 20 geographic Regions
  - over 60 Availability Zones
- Each Amazon Region is designed to be completely isolated from the other Amazon Regions.
- Each Availability Zone is isolated, but the Availability Zones in a Region are connected through low-latency links.

## Security and Compliance

### Security

- Cloud security at AWS is the highest priority
- AWS provides security-specific tools and features across network security, configuration management, access control, and data encryption.
- Benefits of AWS Security
  - Keep Your Data Safe
  - Meet Compliance Requirements
  - Save Money
  - Scale Quickly

### Compliance

- AWS Cloud Compliance enables you to understand the robust controls in place at AWS to maintain security and data protection in the cloud
