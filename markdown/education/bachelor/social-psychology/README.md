## Week 01 - Introduction

## Week 02 - Terrorism

- Three major types of reasoning
  - Inductive: specific scenarios → generalized conclusions
  - Deductive: generalized theory → specific hypotheses
  - Intuitive: use real-life examples and determine what is part and not part of the process
- Define and explain the parameters associated with terrorism
  - Challenges
    - What research questions to study
    - Access to research participants
    - Understand the context [across different cultures]
      - political ideology
      - national culture
      - religious groups
    - What research methodology
      - Quantitative – what closed questions
      - Qualitative – access and agreement to talk about their experiences
  - Definition of terrorism: use violence and extreme methods against civilians and to pursue political, religious, ideological or social objectives (fear and panic)
  - Why are terrorist acts so impactful
    - Random (and unexpected)
    - Threat to everyone
    - Attention worthy
    - Constant reminding
  - Location
    - Organized terrorist groups mostly happen in Africa and South (East) Asia (poor countries)
    - Lone wolf attacks are mostly in modern Western country
  - Trend
    - Fewer incidents but more deadly
  - Ideology
    - Religious (rest of the world) versus political (the West) terrorism
- Types of research
  - Access to terrorists is restricted - qualitative research is highly valid and challenging in terms of reliability
  - Personal risk: researchers are perceived as the enemy
  - Reliability: self-serving bias
  - Morality: Should we conduct interviews with terrorists
- Typical Profile
  - Assumption: certain profile and mentally ill
    - Fundamental attribution bias: only consider personality, not environmental
    - Self-defensive bias: victim blaming
  - The role of the environment is important
  - Terrorist motivation (all human need
    - Identity seeking
    - Revenge seeking
    - Status seeking
    - Thrill-seeking
- Social environmental [cultural] conditions
  - Conflict between Muslims and non-Muslims
  - Social conditions → Frustration with the Indonesian government
  - Extreme action warranted in a “state of [undeclared] war”
  - Suicide bombing is a noble act of martyrdom
- Four stages of radicalization and the major strategies for countering terrorist
  - Radicalization:
    - make complex issues into simple ones with one easy fix
    - try to convince people to believe the same thing → mostly fail → frustration
  - Stages
    - Picking the right person
      - Living in adverse conditions
      - Instances of discrimination
      - Low tolerance for uncertainty
      - Disillusionment with current status
      - Naïve realism
      - Tenuous social network
      - Mentally stable
    - Developing emotional bonds
      - flattery - belongness - importance
      - small benign requests and gradually building up
    - Isolation
      - from people would disagree and report
    - Keeping control
      - reward and punish
      - groupthink
- Outcomes
  - Does terrorism work? In term of ideology and fear, yes
  - Countering
    - Lawmaking
    - Reduce isolation
    - Punishment

## Week 03 - Observation

- Direct/Observational Techniques
  - Without any context, people have difficulty determining who to focus on
  - Importance of observation:
    - Inductive Reasoning: observe everyday behaviour and develop theories/ hypotheses in an attempt to explain human behaviour (specific to general)
    - Theoretical implications: challenge existing theory
  - Issues:
    - Simply observing is **unreliable** and **invalid**
      - Selective Attention: see what they expect (change blindness) and accept what they see (confirmation bias)
      - The narrow focus of their study
    - Solutions:
      - Reliability – use inter-rater reliability to ensure that responses are accurate
      - Validity – observe the whole scene
  - Other techniques:
    - Historical Research
    - Surveys
    - Field/laboratory research
  - Advantages: Good for data collection because it is how people actually behave
  - Disadvantages:
    - Cannot ask why people do it
    - The presence of an observer might alter behaviour
  - Qualitative research with careful observation can falsify existing theories and lead to new theories regarding Cognition and Personality
- Rosenhan’s study on “Being sane in insane places” and Bandura’s social learning study involving Bobo dolls
  - Rosenhan’s study on “Being sane in insane places”
    - Elizabeth Jane Cochrane fake insanity to study mental illness
    - After experiencing the treatment, she discovers the mistreatment of the patient and its negative effect
    - Rosenhan reproduced the approach in an experiment and discovered staff misdiagnose and mistreat patients → Depersonalization and Powerlessness
    - Most institutions are doing more harm than good
    - However, old problems are sane people in insane places, nowadays problems are insane people in sane places → People with mental health issues are not treated properly → commit crimes as a result
  - Bandura’s social learning study involving Bobo dolls
    - Three main questions with competing theory (**Freudian** **theory vs Learning theory)**
      1. how aggressive patterns of behavior are developed
      2. what provokes people to behave aggressively
      3. what determines whether they are going to continue to resort to an aggressive behavior pattern on future occasions
    - Experiment: children were shown violent behaviour, made to be frustrated and then display aggression afterwards
    - Findings
      - children were more influenced by same-sex adults – indicating the powerful **role of models**
      - children displayed a **weapon effect** [using the same weapon in the same way]
      - Encourage violence leads to more violence and discouraging leads to less → Violence video games might lead to more violence
- Compare and contrast Rosenhan’s and Bandura’s research
  - Eight key dimensions
    - Observation usage in qualitative versus quantitative research
      - Qualitative is to discover new things (do not know what to expect)
      - Quantitative is for having a hypothesis and potential answer
    - Observation as technique versus design
      - Unstructured data of unknown area
      - Conventional Data Collection with known concept
    - Observation as self-observation versus outside observer
      - Self-observation: unlimited access to subjective experience but might be bias
      - Outsider: Greater accurate recordings but no subjective POV
    - Observation in naturalistic versus laboratory settings
      - Natural settings: valid ecological but no control over variables
      - Laboratory: Better control but artificial
    - Observation as participant versus observer
      - participant: good for inductive theory development due to personal experience
      - observer: reliable measurement and good for theory testing
    - Observation as unaided versus measuring instrument
      - Unaided: Everything might be recorded but subject to bias
      - Measuring instrument: reliable data but narrowly focused
    - Observation as unstructured versus structured
      - Same vs above
    - Observation as hypothesis testing versus exploratory research
      - exploratory research is to discover a new theory
      - hypothesis testing is to test theory
  - Measuring [observed] behaviour
    - Methods
      - Participant observation
      - Natural observation
      - Unstructured interviews
      - Focus groups
      - Content analyses
      - Analysis of artifacts
    - Dimensions: **frequency, duration and quality**
    - Details description for **reliable: who? does what? to whom? under what conditions?**
- Inductive, deductive and intuitive reasoning.
  - Inductive: discover new theory (not proven yet)
  - Deductive: Theory → hypotheses → Observation → Confirmation (or falsify theory)
  - Intuitive: Distinguishing between two things
- Four types of reliability and four types of validity
  - Dimensions
    - reliability = the degree of consistency in the measured outcome.
    - validity = "does-what-it-should", or measures what it is supposed to measure
  - Types of Reliability
    - Test-retest reliability (reliability over time)
    - Alternate form reliability (different tests)
    - Inter-rater reliability (different scorers)
    - Internal Reliability (audit the scores)
  - Types of Validity:
    - Face validity (eye test)
    - Content Validity (is it the right test)
    - Criterion Validity (Comparing with existing baseline)
    - Construct Validity (Test the test? its approach)
  - **Can a test be reliable but not valid?** Yes
  - **Can a test be valid, but not reliable?** No!

- analyse wording
  | - experimental, quasi-experimental
- interviews with questions
- analyse numbers |
  | Data analysis | happen during collection and text analysis | happen at the end of the process and mostly work with numbers |
  | Advantages | - Ensure validity – exploring issues with knowledgeable informants
- Broad view achieved by exploring context | - Experimenter control and standardization ensures reliability |
  | Disadvantages | - Lack of control - non-standard procedures threaten reliability
- Inductive interpretations will vary across researchers | - Validity of numbers representing human behaviour
- Obtrusiveness of research and myopic view – limited to the variables listed in the hypotheses |
- Overall limitations of each research approach
  - Iterative nature of research
  - Convergence/confirmation
  - Complementary needs
- Combining qualitative and quantitative approaches
  - Priority sequence model: Preliminary vs Follow up
  - Integrated model
- Using inductive reasoning and applying the qualitative approach to understanding challenging issues
  - Analysis begins when the data is first collected and is used to guide decisions related to further data collection
  - Models:
    - Data Saturation
    - Theoretical Saturation
    - Inductive Thematic Saturation
    - A prior thematic Saturation
