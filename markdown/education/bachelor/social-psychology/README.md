## Week 04 - ADHD

## Week 05 - Qualitative and Quantitative Research

- Introduction
  - Reality and Knowledge (Popper’s 3 worlds)
    - World One: Physical World and Objective [knowable] reality
    - World Two: Intentional Rational Mind and Subjective Understanding of World One
    - World Three: Cultural products and Objective concepts that are autonomous
  - Qualitative (Inductive) → Quantitative (Deductive)
  - Designs
    - Case study: Study a small group of people in depth over a period of time. Data is collected via interviews and analysed data
    - Ethnography: Investigate a large group that shares a common culture
    - Phenomenological study: Investigation of a person’s perception of the meaning of an event or situation. Unstructured interviews
    - Grounded theory: begin with data and use inductive reasoning to develop a unique theory
    - Feminist theory: Study a subject through the view of feminist
    - Content [or thematic] analysis: Systematic examination of the contents of a particular body of information to identify themes/patterns
- Critically compare and contrast

| Basic philosophical assumptions about people and knowledge             | There is free will, and there are an subjective reasons behind every actions | Humans have no free will, there is a rule underlying every actions                          |
| Assumptions about people in the role of research subjects/participants | Natural environments, both are equal                                         | Under controlled environments and the roles between experts and subject are clearly defined |
| Selection of participants                                              | Data Driven Selection                                                        | Random Sampling                                                                             |
| Research design                                                        | Inductive process → explore new idea                                         | Deductive: hypotheses → answer                                                              |
| Methodology differences and measurements                               | - informal interview                                                         |                                                                                             |

- analyse wording
  | - experimental, quasi-experimental
- interviews with questions
- analyse numbers |
  | Data analysis | happen during collection and text analysis | happen at the end of the process and mostly work with numbers |
  | Advantages | - Ensure validity – exploring issues with knowledgeable informants
- Broad view achieved by exploring context | - Experimenter control and standardization ensures reliability |
  | Disadvantages | - Lack of control - non-standard procedures threaten reliability
- Inductive interpretations will vary across researchers | - Validity of numbers representing human behaviour
- Obtrusiveness of research and myopic view – limited to the variables listed in the hypotheses |
- Overall limitations of each research approach
  - Iterative nature of research
  - Convergence/confirmation
  - Complementary needs
- Combining qualitative and quantitative approaches
  - Priority sequence model: Preliminary vs Follow up
  - Integrated model
- Using inductive reasoning and applying the qualitative approach to understanding challenging issues
  - Analysis begins when the data is first collected and is used to guide decisions related to further data collection
  - Models:
    - Data Saturation
    - Theoretical Saturation
    - Inductive Thematic Saturation
    - A prior thematic Saturation
