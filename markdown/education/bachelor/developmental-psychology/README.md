# Developmental Psychology

## Week 01 - Introduction

## Week 02 - Prenatal Development, Genetics and Epigenetics

- Pregnancy is about week to week development (a lot of things happen in 40 weeks)
- Brain development starts from week 9
- Three Pre-Natal Periods
  - Germinal: 0-2 weeks
    - Egg is fertilised. Divides rapidly but still looks like a bundle of cells rather than a baby.
  - Embryonic: 2-8 weeks
    - 3 Layers
      - ECTODERM- Nervous System, Skin & Hair
      - MESODERM- Muscles, Bone, Circulatory System and Internal Organs
      - ENDODERM- Digestive System, Lungs, Urinary Tract, Glands
  - Foetal: 8 weeks to birth
    - The Foetal Period - 14 weeks
      - The foetus is 9cm long, weight 45 gms
      - Ears are fully developed
      - Hair is appearing
      - Kidneys produce urine
      - Girls- ovaries are moving down towards the pelvis.
      - Boys- prostate gland is developing
    - 16 weeks
      - The foetus is approx. 12cm and weighs 100 gms
      - Covered with a protective soft down to regulate its temperature (lanuga)
      - Fat begins to form underneath skin
      - Hears external voices, sleeps, dreams
      - Breathes-regular movements of chest- encourages lung development and grow
      - Facial expressions, e.g. squinting, frowning
      - Grasps with hands, kicks, and somersaults!
    - 20 weeks
      - The foetus has grown to 27 cm, weighs 360 grams).
      - Bone marrow begins making blood cells
      - Small intestine absorbs sugars (instead of placenta providing all nutrients)
      - Girls - external genital organs have formed and ovaries contain over 6 million
      - Boys - testes begin to descend from the abdomen – no sperm produced until puberty
      - Recognises the mother's voice and may respond to some types of music
    - 26 weeks
      - Viability (survival outside the womb) depends on technology
      - 35.5cm long, weighs over 760 gms
      - Hands are very active and eyes begin to open
      - Can suck thumb
    - 36 weeks
      - Length is +-48 cm, weight is 2.7kg
      - Body is becoming chubby as fat layers build
      - Between now and birth they gain about 30g/day a day
      - Looks like a baby now
    - 40 weeks
      - Teratogens (anything that affects foetal development)
        - Drugs
        - Environmental
        - Infectious Disease
        - Controllable
          - Caffeine
          - Alcohol
            - FAS (Feotal Alcohol Spectrum)
            - ARND (Alcohol-related neuro developmental disorders)
            - ARBD (Alcohol-related birth defects)
          - Cigarettes
            - SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome)
          - Stress
            - Affects genetics expression
          - Age of parents
          - Nutrition
      - Effects of Teratogens
        - Critical period: organ system growing
        - Dosage and usage: greater levels and longer exposure → greater effects
        - Genetics makup: Susceptibility to harm
        - Environments: Depends on Controllable
- Influences
  - Genetics
    - Problems associated with genes
    - Gene: unit of hereditary information
    - Chromosomes are strings of DNA: in cell nucleus (thymine, guanine, adenine, cytosine)- GATTACA
    - Sex chromosomes- single pair of chromosomes
    - Autosomes- 22 pairs of chromosomes
    - Gregor Mendel: Dominant and recessive - genetic makeup versus expression
    - Disorders
      - Most (but not all) are recessive. That means if one parent has the defective gene, but the other doesn’t, it will not be expressed.
  - Environmental
    - Trauma has epigenetic effects on an individual
    - These changes may impact negatively on the individual’s physical and psychological health
    - But can the epigenetic effects of trauma be inherited?
    - Yes, if children/grandchildren of holocaust survivors for instance, inherit these epigenetic changes, they too have poorer physical and psychological health than their peer group
  - Limitation of heritability of behaviour study
    - Measure epigenetic markers in blood and saliva
    - This may not reflect what is going on in the brain
    - Also need to tease out effects of upbringing – might have a direct effect on epigenetic markers
    - Are epigenetic markers a cause or consequence of behaviour or just an epiphenomenon?
  - Children born with mother using SSRI (Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) tend to withdraw. Symptoms may include jitteriness, irritability, feeding difficulties, and sometimes respiratory distress. These symptoms are usually temporary and can be managed by medical professionals.

## Week 03 - Evolutionary Psychology

- Develop an understanding of precursors to evolutionary psychology.
  - Explain any aspect of human psychology with principles of **evolutionary biology**
  - Integrates biological and environmental influences
    - There is random variation within organisms and some variants are more adaptive to the environment than others
    - Difference environment develops different mechanism for evolution
  - William James “Principles of Psychology” believes that Instincts have a purpose which is usually to promote survival
  - Innateness: traits that exist naturally, or are inherited, rather than being
    learnt through experience. They are studied through gene
  - behaviorism is about blank state and learning through experience and environmental interactions
    - No interest in the ‘black box’- ie unobservable mental processes
  - Cognitive revolution tries to understand the mental processes
- Develop an understanding of evolutionary psychology
  - The brain is an organic computer with a lot of circuits and the interaction between circuits produce behaviour
  - The neural circuits system that we have is the one survival through evolution
  - The brain has specialized modules
  - An evidence is six common emotion, which shares among all human
- Develop an understanding of the application of evolutionary psychology to developmental psychology.
  - Neural plasticity in children provides an obvious route for evolutionary change, which means there is a chance for change
  - People mostly shares the same fear during certain age group
