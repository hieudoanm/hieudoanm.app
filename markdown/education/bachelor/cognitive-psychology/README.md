## Week 01 - Introduction and the Cognitive Revolution

### Cognitive Revolution

- Definition: all forms of knowing and awareness, such as perceiving, conceiving, remembering, reasoning, judging, imagining, and problem-solving. Along with affect and conation, it is one of the three traditionally identified components of mind.
- Dominant Paradigm of modern psychology
  - Cognitive Therapy
  - Cognitive Behaviour Therapy
  - Schema Therapy
- Behaviourism: Rise and fall
  - 1930s memory research limitations flagged
  - 1940s behaviourism no longer a magic bullet
  - 1950s a cognitive revolution was brewing
  - 1960s cognitive psychology was a legitimised discipline of scientific thought
    - The Harvard Center for Cognitive Studies
    - Centre for Human Information Processing at the University of California San Diego
  - 1970-80s cognitive science gained dominance over behaviourism.
    Most psychologists prefer this approach today.
- Behaviourism vs Cognition
  - Behaviourism: Stimuli → Action
  - Cognition: Stimuli → Detection → Process → Response

| Evolutionary | Behaviourism | Cognition | Neuroscience |
| ------------ | ------------ | --------- | ------------ |

| Fear is a natural response to
perceived danger. | Fear is learned from
experience (e.g., classical &
operant conditioning) | Fear is a complex interplay
between several cognitive
factors. | Different brain regions
activating (fMRI) to
demonstrate the complex
interplay. Supports cognitive
theories. |
| | We can be exposed to new
(positive) experiences to
change our future behaviour. | We can change our thinking
to help modify our
psychophysiological response
and our behaviour. | We can rewire our neural
networks through changes in
our thinking. |

### Limitations of Cognitive Science

- Cognitive Science = Psychology + Neuroscience + Computer Science (BCI + AI + HCI)
- Problems
  - Ecological validity
    - Artificiality vs. Naturality: Evidence indicates that virtual reality interventions do transfer to real world
      experience
    - Simplicity vs. Complexity
    - Hawthorne effect: People act differently when being observed
  - Reducibility
    - Cannot pinpoint exactly where things are although we understand neural communication
  - Generalisability
    - Two brains are not the same → no one-size-fits-all treatment
  - Internal consistency
    - The field is still in active research and there is no universal framework
- Key debates
  - Top-down vs. bottom-up processing
  - Modular or integrated
  - Reducible or holistic
  - Realistic or pragmatic
- Approaches
  - Socratic Method: Keep asking questions
  - Hegelian Dialectic: Aim for middle ground → Thesis + Antithesis = Synthesis
  - Converging Operations: There are a lot of variables

### Computationalism vs. Connectionism

- A thought is not a single node or even a single neuron.
- Computationalism
  - Is the mind like a computer? The computer model helps explain some basic mind activities.
- Connectionism
  - The brain is a biological organ → More synaptic excitement = more phenomena → Neural networking
  - Strength of associations within the mind/brain
  - Individual differences based on prior experiences

## Week 02 - Perception

- Contrast perception theories of Gibson and Gregory.
  - Raw information to meaningful interpretation
    - sensation → perception → attention
  - Data via sensory registers is selected, organised, and interpreted
  - Bottom-up theory (brightness, texture, distance): Sensation=perception → we all see the world the same way
  - Top-down processing: sensory data → prior knowledge → interference
  - Features
    - TD without sensory input is meaningless
    - BU without cognition is a sensory soup
    - TP/BU processes interact - data from 1 sense is usually insufficient
    - Processing without judgment renders limited representations
    - TP/BU perception in terms of ‘multisensory’ (MSI) processes across brain regions
  - Integrated Theory
    - Unimodal perception
    - Multi-modal perception (Multi-sensory integration)
      - Brain zones optimise input from multiple senses
      - Multiple senses—balanced
      - Multi-sensory stimuli always integrated in the
        most "optimal" way
    - Cross-modal perception (One modality influences another)
      - One modality influences another
      - Modern technologies assist repair of perceptual
        functions in cases where damage has occurred
      - Neuro-prosthetics which make use of cross-
        modal processes to regain function
  - Snapshot: Synesthesia → which one is it? Unimodal? Multi-modal? Cross-modal?
- Understand the interplay between bottom-up and top-down
  processing of visual stimuli.
- Demonstrate an understanding of multi-sensory integration.
- Understand object recognition according to template
  matching, feature detection and recognition by
  components. - Object Recognition - Form, colour and motion processed separately then combined. - Akinetopsia (motion blindness) (common in stroke, Alzheimer, and drug induced) - Damaged in visual medial temporal V5 - Inconspicuous Akinetopsia: Akin to seeing motion as a cinema reel - Gross Akinetopsia: Profound motion blindness and struggle in psychosocial functioning. - Purpose of Visual perception - Perception and Ventral (identify/recognise) - Slower - Memory-based - High consciousness - Can be monocular - Action and Dorsal (interact) - Fast - Motion-focused - Low consciousness - Very short-term memory - Strength of binocular vision - Pattern Recognition - Template matching - Argues we have stored templates that we use to match objects in our environment. - Infinite variety of patterns and different orientations - Feature detection theories - Analysis-by-synthesis - Extract features to sensory register (brief memory) - Match to long-term-memory features - Make decision about the object (outcome) - Issues (Stimuli with shared features) - Recognition by components
- Explain 4 arguments for holistic detection in face recognition
  theories. - Very different from object recognition - Extremely important for humans - Recognise friends/family - Detection vs Recognition (eyes, noses, mouth) - Interpret emotions - Pattern for emotion - Holistic Processing (Suggests a top-down process) - Inversion Effect - More easily when the right way up - Part vs. Whole - Recognize something that is shown only part of it (see the eye and recognize the face - Composite Effect - The organization of things - Prosopagnosia - Unable to recognise faces but can easily detect objects - Acquired (brain injury) vs Developmental (genetic) - Autism Spectrum Disorder & Faces - The child with ASD scan faces differently
- Understand the complexity of face detection versus object
  detection.
