# Asymtonic Notation

## Big Theta (Θ)

- We use big Theta when a program has only one case in term of runtime.

## Common Runtimes

- Θ(1). This is constant runtime. This is the runtime when a program will always do the same thing regardless of the input. For instance, a program that only prints “hello, world” runs in Θ(1) because the program will always just print “hello, world”.
- Θ(log N). This is logarithmic runtime. You will see this runtime in search algorithms.
- Θ(N). This is linear runtime. You will often see this when you have to iterate through an entire dataset.
- Θ(N\*logN). You will see this runtime in sorting algorithms.
- Θ(N2). This is an example of a polynomial runtime. You will see this runtime when you have to search through a two-dimensional dataset (like a matrix) or nested loops.
- Θ(2N). This is exponential runtime. You will often see this runtime in recursive algorithms (Don’t worry if you don’t know what that is yet!).
- Θ(N!). This is factorial runtime. You will often see this runtime when you have to generate all of the different permutations of something. For instance, a program that generates all the different ways to order the letters “abcd” would run in this runtime.

## Big Omega (Ω) and Big O (O)

- We use big Omega or Ω to describe the best case and big O or O to describe the worst case.
