- Angular is a framework and React is a library. Therefore React is more flexiable.
- Angular uses Traditional DOM while React uses Virtual DOM. Virtual DOM provides better performance since it only updates changed node instead of re-render the entire DOM tree.
- Angular uses two-way (bi-directional) data binding while React uses one-way (unidirectional) data binding computations. In Angular, you can update the state and it will affect the UI and vice-versa. In React, you can change the state and it will update the UI but not vice versa. For React, it is easier to debug.
- Angular is HTML supported by JS Framework and React combines UI templates and inline JavaScript logic in its iconic language known as JSX. React is better for development since markup code and logic is in the same place.
- In term of community, Angular and React is relatively and same. React has more stars and forks on GitHub but Angular has more support on StackOverflow
- For testing, React has Jest and Angular has Jasmine
- Angular has a higher learning curve than React
