DOM takes all the HTML elements and wraps them in an object with a tree-structure.

Virtual DOM is an abstraction of your Real DOM but it's pretty light-weight than the Real DOM.

Virtual DOM is very easy to understand if you take an example of a lift which has a mirror inside it. Suppose, 4 people enters into the lift. Now, the mirror will reflect its appearance with 4 people. Again people entering into the lift will reflect the object of mirror. And same effect happens when people exit from the lift, the mirror object gets changes (increase, decrease, or even empty). So, in reality mirror has no real object, but it only reflects its presence with outer object.
