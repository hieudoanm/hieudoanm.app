- Angular is TypeScript based. Work with Components and Directives. ( ) and [ ] attributes are used for two way binding between view and model. Mobile Friendly (Ionic).
- AngularJS is JavaScript based. Works on MVC. {{ }} expressions are used for two way binding between view and model. Special methods, ng-bind can also be used to do the same. Prefer a hierarchical dependency injection.
